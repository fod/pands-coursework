# Use a while loop to print all even numbers from 2 to to 100
# Author: Fiachra O' Donoghue

# Initialise the counter variable
counter = 2

# This loop will repeatedly print the counter variable then increment it by 2 until the 
# stopping condition (counter < 101) is met
while (counter < 101):
    print (counter)
    counter += 2
